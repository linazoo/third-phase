#Introduction to Phase 3

## Welcome

Congratulations! You've made it to Phase 3. We're going to
dive head first into a sea of technologies and methodologies to help you grow as both a web developer and a high-functioning team member.

This phase is incredibly demanding and you'll feel stretched right up
until graduation day. Be ready to give your all as you push toward demo day.
You'll get the most out of this if you stay curious, hold yourself and your
peers to high standards, and most importantly support each other.

During Phase 3, you'll be treated like professional developers.  By now your ability to teach yourself should be at a high level, and we'll be expecting you to use it and share the fruits of your learning with everyone in the cohort. Expect less support from your instructors, as over the next three weeks you're going to be developing habits that will serve you for the rest of your career. We place more value on quality code and great teamwork than on quantity of features.

## Working Agreement

- Challenges will be bigger and more open-ended. In addition to learning new technologies, an additional challenge will be strategizing how to approach the problem (e.g., how to debug or researching a problem).
- Most evenings will have prep work or micro-challenges to prepare you for the next day. You are expected to complete this work before the following morning's lecture.
- Morning lectures will introduce context for the day's work—except during group projects when there will be no lectures.
- Instructors will perform code reviews of select challenges and will be as critical and opinionated as they would of a coworker's code.
- You are expected to submit only 100% peer-reviewed code to your projects using a pull-request Git workflow.
- Yoga is Thursday's at 8:00am. Yoga is mandatory during the first week of Phase 3 and optional during final projects.
