## Weekend

### Core

**Talks**

Choose a [Gemsy Talk Topic](../resources/gemsy_talk_topics.md) (using a Gem within a Rails app) and prepare your lightning talk.

**Solo Project**

We want you to take this opportunity before final projects begin to build something that satisfies and expands your curiosity. Build an app with a client-side framework. Explore a different data store. Deploy a Rails application to a VPS like DigitalOcean or Linode that you set up yourself. Write a JavaScript game. Write an app in Python. Write one tiny app six times in six different JavaScript frameworks.

Satisfy that curious person that made you sign up to DBC in the first place who's been watching the last 7 weeks go by, picking up knowledge and power and wondering how to use it.

Build something, and then show us on Monday morning. Make yourself proud.

**Prep for Monday**
- Watch this [Advanced JavaScript Talk](https://talks.devbootcamp.com/mvc-oojs-memory-game)
- Read this [Jasmine intro](../resources/jasmine.md) to get familiar with JavaScript testing.
- [Jasmine documentation](http://jasmine.github.io)
